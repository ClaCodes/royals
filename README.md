# royals
Strategic card game

## Run command line version
Run `cargo run --bin royals_ui_cli` to play the game in CLI mode. You will be prompted for actions. Enter `r` to display the rules or `c` to display the card effects when prompted. Press `q` to abort the game early.

## Run Bevy UI version (release)
Run `cargo run -r --bin royals_ui_bevy` to play the game with the Bevy UI.

## Run Bevy UI version (debug)
Run `cargo run --bin royals_ui_bevy` to play the game with the Bevy UI in debug mode (compiles faster but runs slower).
